# Pollution vs. Life Expectancy Or: How I Learned to Stop Worry and Breathe the Toxins

## Background:
This project was completed for our undergraduate capstone requirement at Texas A&M University (TAMU) Department of Statistics, under the instruction of Dr. Lan Zhou, an associate professor in the department. The dataset for pollutant levels was downloaded from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) website. Life expectancy data was collected from the U.S. CDC website and the American Medical Association (AMA). 

## Project Description:
Like every biological organism, human beings have always influenced the environment in which they inhabit. However, unlike other species, humans have been inexorably proliferating their environmental impact to cataclysmic levels. Between greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, and toxic air pollutants like carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, humans have released an unfathomable amount of pollution into the atmosphere. With so many different air pollutants and so much of each of them, some, if not all, will have tangible effects on the life expectancies of those subjected to them. 

The aim of this project is to determine if there is any association between the different toxic air pollutants and greenhouse gases in respect to life expectancy among the fifty American states. We intend to investigate whether specific pollutants have a stronger influence on life expectancy than others.
